# Data Security-Best Practices

- **Data Classification:**  
  Identify and classify your data based on sensitivity to ensure that the most critical data receives the highest level of protection.

- **Access Control:**  
  - Implement role-based access control (RBAC) and the principle of least privilege.  
  - Use strong, unique passwords and multi-factor authentication (MFA) to prevent unauthorized access.

- **Encryption:**  
  - Encrypt sensitive data both at rest and in transit.  
  - Ensure that encryption keys are managed securely and rotated regularly.

### Data Handling Procedures

- **Data Minimization:**  
  Collect only the data necessary for your operations. Avoid storing sensitive data unless absolutely required.
- **Data Retention:**  
  Define and enforce data retention policies to ensure that data is not kept longer than necessary. Regularly review and purge old data.
- **Data Masking:**											
  Use data masking techniques to protect sensitive information in non-production environments, such as development and testing.
