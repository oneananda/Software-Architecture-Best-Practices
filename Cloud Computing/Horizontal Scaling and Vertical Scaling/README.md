# Horizontal Scaling and Vertical Scaling

### Horizontal Scaling (Scale Out/In)

Involves adding more machines or instances to your existing pool of resources. This is commonly referred to as "scaling out" (adding more servers) or "scaling in" (removing servers).

### Vertical Scaling (Scale Up/Down)

Involves adding more power (CPU, RAM, storage) to an existing server or machine. This is known as "scaling up" (adding more resources) or "scaling down" (reducing resources).
