# **High Availability** and **Fault Tolerance** 


| **Concept**        | **Definition**                                                                                                                | **Key Features**                                          |
|--------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------|
| **High Availability** | Ensures that a system or application remains operational and accessible with minimal downtime, typically through redundancy and failover mechanisms. | - Redundancy across regions/availability zones<br> - Load balancing<br> - Health checks |
| **Fault Tolerance** | The ability of a system to continue operating despite failures of individual components or subsystems, often through hardware or software redundancy. | - Replication across systems<br> - Self-healing infrastructure<br> - Automated recovery |

### Key Differences:

- **High Availability**: Focuses on **minimizing downtime** through distribution of resources and failover mechanisms.
- **Fault Tolerance**: Focuses on **continuing operation despite failures** through component redundancy and self-healing.
