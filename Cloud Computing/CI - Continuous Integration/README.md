# Continuous Integration (CI)

This is a process of triggering auto builds and testing whenever any checkins / merges are happening to the repository, this will ensure that the repos are tested and ensures the errors are detected earlier

## Key things

### Frequent Integration
### Automated Builds
### Automated Testing
### Immediate Feedback
### Deployment Readiness 

## **CI Workflow:**

- Code Commit: A developer writes code and commits it to a version control system (like Git).
- Trigger Build: The commit triggers the CI server to pull the latest code from the repository.
- Automated Build: The CI server compiles the code and creates a build.
- Automated Testing: The CI server runs automated tests against the build to check for any issues.
- Feedback: The CI server provides feedback to the developer, indicating whether the build and tests were successful or if there were any issues.
- Fixing Issues: If issues are found, the developer fixes them and recommits the code, repeating the process.
