# Cloud Computing Best Practices

## Introduction

This repository is dedicated to collecting and sharing best practices in cloud computing. It covers various aspects such as CI (Continuous Integration), CD (Continuous Deployment/Delivery), security, scalability, cost management, and more. Each section provides guidelines, examples, and resources to help you implement these best practices in your cloud projects.

## Continuous Integration (CI)

### What is CI?
This is a process of triggering auto builds and testing whenever any checkins / merges are happening to the repository, this will ensure that the repos are tested and ensures the errors are detected earlier, and make sure the integeration is maintained.

### Best Practices for CI
- **Frequent Commits**: Integrate code frequently, at least daily, to detect issues early.
- **Automated Builds**: Ensure that every commit triggers an automated build process.
- **Automated Testing**: Implement unit tests, integration tests, and other automated tests to catch bugs early.
- **Use of CI Tools**: Utilize CI tools like Jenkins, GitHub Actions, Azure Pipelines, or AWS CodeBuild to automate the CI process.

## Continuous Deployment/Delivery (CD)

### What is CD?
Continuous Deployment (CD) is the practice of automatically deploying every change that passes all stages of your production pipeline. Continuous Delivery, on the other hand, is the practice of ensuring that your code is always in a deployable state, allowing for manual deployment at any time.

### Best Practices for CD
- **Automated Deployments**: Automate deployments to reduce manual errors and increase deployment frequency.
- **Blue-Green Deployments**: Use blue-green deployments to minimize downtime and reduce the risk of deploying changes.
- **Canary Releases**: Gradually roll out changes to a subset of users to catch issues before full deployment.
- **Continuous Monitoring**: Monitor deployments in real-time to detect and respond to any issues quickly.
- **Rollback Strategy**: Implement a rollback strategy to revert to a previous stable version if a deployment fails.
