## Continuous Integration (CI)

### What is CI?
Continuous Integration (CI) is a software development practice where developers frequently integrate their code changes into a shared repository. Each integration is verified by an automated build and tests, allowing teams to detect problems early.

### Best Practices for CI
- **Frequent Commits**: Integrate code frequently, at least daily, to detect issues early.
- **Automated Builds**: Ensure that every commit triggers an automated build process.
- **Automated Testing**: Implement unit tests, integration tests, and other automated tests to catch bugs early.
- **Use of CI Tools**: Utilize CI tools like Jenkins, GitHub Actions, Azure Pipelines, or AWS CodeBuild to automate the CI process.
