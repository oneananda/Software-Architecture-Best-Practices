# ✅ GitFlow Branching Strategy


### Best Practices 1
	
### 🔁 Flow Summary

* **main**: Only contains production-ready code. Tagged releases happen here.
* **develop**: Integrates all completed features and is used for testing pre-release code.
* **feature/**: Short-lived branches off `develop`, merged back when feature is complete.
* **release/**: Created from `develop` when preparing for a release. Final bugfixes happen here.
* **hotfix/**: Created from `main` to patch urgent issues in production. Merged back to both `main` and `develop`.

---

### 📌 Best Practices Illustrated

* Use descriptive names for branches (`feature/login-form`, `hotfix/2.1.1`).
* Keep branches short-lived to avoid drift.
* Always merge `hotfix` and `release` into both `main` and `develop`.
* Tag all production releases on `main`.

### Best Practices 2

### 🔁 GitHub Flow Summary

* **main**: Always deployable.
* **feature branches**: Created directly off `main`, one per task or issue.
* Pull requests trigger:
  * Code reviews
  * Automated CI tests
* Once approved and passed, they’re merged into `main`.
* Deployments happen automatically from `main`.

---

### 📌 Best Practices

* **One branch per issue/task** (short-lived, focused).
* **Pull Request (PR)** required for all merges.
* **CI/CD pipelines** enforce quality gates.
* **Deploy from `main`**, often via automation.
* Avoid long-lived branches (e.g., no `develop`, `release`).

### 👥 Best For

* Teams practicing continuous deployment.
* Startups and SaaS products with frequent releases.
* Projects using GitHub Actions or similar automation.
