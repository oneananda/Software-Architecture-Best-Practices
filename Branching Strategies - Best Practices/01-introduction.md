## Why Branching Strategies Matter

Branching strategies are a foundational aspect of modern software development using version control systems like Git. They define **how teams collaborate, organize work, and manage changes** to codebases — particularly in fast-paced or large-scale projects.

Without a clear branching strategy, teams may face:

* Frequent **merge conflicts**
* **Broken main branches**
* Unclear ownership of changes
* Difficulty tracking features or hotfixes
* Challenges in coordinating releases

A well-defined branching strategy enables teams to:

* **Work in parallel** without stepping on each other’s toes
* Maintain **code stability** in mainline branches
* Manage **releases and hotfixes** efficiently
* Ensure **traceability and accountability** of changes
* Support **automation** through CI/CD pipelines
