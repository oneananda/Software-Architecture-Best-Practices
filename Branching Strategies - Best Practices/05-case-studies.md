## Real-World Use Cases of Branching Strategies

Different teams adopt branching strategies based on their product type, team dynamics, release cadence, and tooling. This section highlights real-world examples to show how these strategies are applied in practice.

## 🏢 Case Study 1: Enterprise SaaS Company (Using Git Flow)

**Company Profile:**

* \~80 developers across multiple teams
* Monthly releases, QA-heavy process
* Regulated industry (finance)

**Strategy:**

* **Git Flow** for structure and control.
* Long-lived `main` and `develop` branches.
* `feature/` branches for each user story.
* `release/` branches for QA and UAT testing.
* `hotfix/` branches for critical production issues.

**Why It Works:**

* Formal staging and testing cycles.
* Allows controlled, versioned releases with rollback ability.
* Supports parallel development and emergency fixes.

## 🚀 Case Study 2: Startup with CI/CD Pipeline (Using GitHub Flow)

**Company Profile:**

* <10 engineers
* Continuous deployment to production
* Fast-moving product iterations

**Strategy:**

* **GitHub Flow** for simplicity and speed.
* Developers branch from `main`, open a PR, run CI tests, and deploy after merge.
* PRs serve as both code review checkpoints and deployment triggers.

**Why It Works:**

* Low overhead.
* Encourages fast feedback and continuous delivery.
* Aligns with a small team focused on rapid feature delivery.

## 🧪 Case Study 3: Mid-Size Product Team (Using GitLab Flow)

**Company Profile:**

* \~30 developers
* Staging and production environments
* Feature flags and CI/CD

**Strategy:**

* **GitLab Flow (environment-based)**.
* Use of `main`, `staging`, and `production` branches.
* `feature/` branches merged into `main`, which auto-deploys to staging.
* Production deployment requires a manual merge from `main` to `production`.

**Why It Works:**

* Balances fast iteration with controlled deployment.
* Integrates well with GitLab’s issue boards and pipelines.
* Allows time for QA in staging without blocking development.

## 📱 Case Study 4: Mobile App Development (Using Release Branching)

**Company Profile:**

* Mobile dev team for Android/iOS
* Multiple app versions live in stores
* Long-term support required

**Strategy:**

* **Release Branching** model.
* `main` for latest version.
* `release/1.x`, `release/2.x` for supported versions.
* Bug fixes are cherry-picked or merged into active release branches.

**Why It Works:**

* Supports multiple parallel versions.
* Critical fixes can be isolated and tested per release line.
* Ideal for environments with external app store release constraints.
