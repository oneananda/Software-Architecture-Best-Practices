# 06 - Tools and Automation

## Automating Branching Workflows for Efficiency and Consistency

Branching strategies are most effective when backed by the right tooling and automation. Manual processes can lead to inconsistency, missed checks, or deployment delays. This section outlines essential tools and practices that support branching workflows at scale.

## 🧰 Version Control Tools

### 1. **Git**

The foundation for all branching strategies.

* `git branch`, `git checkout`, `git merge`, `git rebase`, etc.
* Local and remote branch management.
* Tags for versioning (especially with Git Flow or Release Branching).

### 2. **Hosted Platforms**

Popular platforms that provide collaboration, automation, and visibility.

| Platform     | Features                                                |
| ------------ | ------------------------------------------------------- |
| GitHub       | Pull Requests, Actions (CI/CD), branch protection rules |
| GitLab       | Merge Requests, Pipelines, Environments, Auto DevOps    |
| Bitbucket    | Pipelines, Branch permissions, Smart Mirroring          |
| Azure DevOps | Repos, Pipelines, Policy enforcement                    |

## ⚙️ Continuous Integration & Deployment (CI/CD)

CI/CD tools run tests, build artifacts, and deploy code automatically when changes occur in specific branches.

### Common CI/CD Tools:

* **GitHub Actions** (best for GitHub)
* **GitLab CI/CD** (tight integration with GitLab)
* **CircleCI**, **Travis CI**, **Jenkins**, **Azure Pipelines**
* **Bitbucket Pipelines** for Atlassian environments

### Best Practices:

* Trigger builds/tests on pull/merge requests.
* Deploy from `main`, `release/*`, or `production` branches.
* Use branch-based environment mapping (e.g., `main` → staging, `production` → prod).
* Set up branch-specific rules for test coverage or linting.
