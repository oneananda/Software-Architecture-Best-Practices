# General branching best practices:

## Naming conventions:

- Use clear and descriptive names for branches.
- Use a consistent naming pattern (e.g., `feature/`, `bugfix/`, `hotfix/`).
- Include issue numbers or ticket IDs in branch names for traceability.
- Use lowercase letters and hyphens or underscores to separate words.

## Keeping branches short-lived:

- Aim to keep branches short-lived to reduce merge conflicts.
- Merge or rebase frequently to keep branches up to date with the main branch.
- Encourage developers to work on small, incremental changes.

## Regular rebasing or merging:

- Regularly rebase or merge branches to keep them up to date with the main branch.
- Use `git rebase` for a cleaner history, but be cautious with shared branches.

## Using pull requests / merge requests

- Use pull requests (PRs) or merge requests (MRs) for code reviews and collaboration.
- Encourage team members to review and comment on PRs/MRs.
- Use PR/MR templates to standardize information and ensure all necessary checks are performed.
- Use PR/MR labels to categorize and prioritize them.

## Code review and CI integration

- Integrate code review and continuous integration (CI) into the branching strategy.
- Use CI tools to automatically run tests and checks on PRs/MRs.
- Ensure that all tests pass before merging branches.
- Encourage team members to review code for quality and maintainability.
