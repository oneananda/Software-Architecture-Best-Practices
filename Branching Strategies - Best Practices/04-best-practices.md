# General branching best practices:

## Naming conventions:

- Use clear and descriptive names for branches.
- Use a consistent naming pattern (e.g., `feature/`, `bugfix/`, `hotfix/`).
- Include issue numbers or ticket IDs in branch names for traceability.
- Use lowercase letters and hyphens or underscores to separate words.
