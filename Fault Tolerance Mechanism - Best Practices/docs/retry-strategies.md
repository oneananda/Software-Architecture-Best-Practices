# Retry Strategies

## Why Do We Need Retry Strategies?

In any distributed system, failures are inevitable. Network glitches, temporary outages, or even a slow response from an external API can cause an operation to fail. Instead of throwing in the towel right away, retrying the operation can often solve the problem, especially when the failure is just a temporary hiccup.

But here’s the catch: retrying isn’t as simple as just hitting "try again." If done poorly, retries can overwhelm the system or make things worse. That’s why using well-thought-out retry strategies is key to building a fault-tolerant system.
