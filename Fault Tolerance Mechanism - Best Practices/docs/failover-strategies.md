# Failover Strategies

Failover strategies are designed to automatically switch to a backup system, server, or network when a primary system fails. The goal is to maintain uninterrupted service by having a standby component take over seamlessly when an issue arises. Failover mechanisms are crucial in critical applications where downtime is not an option, such as in financial services, healthcare systems, and high-traffic websites.

By implementing effective failover strategies, you can ensure that your system remains highly available, even in the face of hardware failures, network outages, or other unforeseen issues. This not only improves user experience but also enhances the reliability and resilience of your overall infrastructure.
