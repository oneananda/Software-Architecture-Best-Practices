# Chaos Engineering

Chaos Engineering is the practice of deliberately introducing faults and failures into a system to test its resilience and identify weaknesses. The goal is to simulate real-world issues—like server crashes, network outages, or sudden traffic spikes—in a controlled environment to see how the system reacts and recovers. By proactively experimenting with potential failure scenarios, you can uncover hidden vulnerabilities and improve the robustness of your system.

Chaos Engineering helps build confidence in the system's ability to withstand unexpected disruptions, ultimately leading to more reliable and fault-tolerant applications. It’s a crucial approach for organizations that prioritize high availability and seamless user experiences.

### Common Chaos Engineering Tools
- **Chaos Monkey**: Part of Netflix's "Simian Army," Chaos Monkey randomly terminates instances in a system to ensure it can handle unexpected server failures.
- **Gremlin**: Provides a variety of failure scenarios to simulate, such as network outages, server crashes, and CPU spikes.
- **Chaos Mesh**: A cloud-native chaos engineering platform for Kubernetes, allowing fine-grained control over experiments in Kubernetes environments.
