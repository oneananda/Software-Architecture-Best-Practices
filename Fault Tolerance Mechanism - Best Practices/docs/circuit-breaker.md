# Circuit Breaker Pattern

The Circuit Breaker pattern is a powerful fault tolerance mechanism designed to prevent repeated failures from overwhelming a system. Think of it as a trip switch in your electrical system: if there's a problem (like an overload), it "trips" and stops the flow to prevent further damage. In software, it works similarly by "breaking the circuit" when a system detects a series of failures.

When a service or operation fails repeatedly, the circuit breaker kicks in and stops further attempts for a set period of time. This helps the system avoid wasting resources on operations that are unlikely to succeed and gives it time to recover.
