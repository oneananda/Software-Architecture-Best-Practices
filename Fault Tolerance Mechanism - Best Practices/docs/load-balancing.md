# Load Balancing

Load balancing is a technique used to distribute incoming network traffic or computational tasks across multiple servers or resources. The main goal is to ensure no single server becomes a bottleneck, thereby improving the overall performance, reliability, and availability of your system. By balancing the load, you can prevent server overloads, reduce response times, and increase fault tolerance.

Load balancing works like a traffic cop, directing requests to different servers based on various factors like current server load, response times, or availability. This not only ensures optimal resource utilization but also helps maintain seamless user experiences, even during high traffic periods or unexpected spikes.
