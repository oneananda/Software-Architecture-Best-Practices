# Fault Tolerance Mechanism - Best Practices

## Overview

This repository contains a collection of fault tolerance mechanisms, best practices, and implementation strategies to ensure the robustness and high availability of software systems. The content is designed to help developers, system architects, and engineers build applications that can handle failures gracefully, minimize downtime, and ensure continuity of service.

## Key Concepts

The repository covers the following key concepts:

- **Retry Strategies:** Techniques to handle transient failures by retrying failed operations.
- **Circuit Breaker:** A design pattern to detect failures and avoid repetitive failures during maintenance or temporary issues.
- **Load Balancing:** Distributing workloads across multiple computing resources to ensure no single resource is overwhelmed.
- **Failover Strategies:** Techniques to switch to a backup system in case the primary system fails.
- **Chaos Engineering:** A practice of testing systems' resilience by intentionally introducing faults.
