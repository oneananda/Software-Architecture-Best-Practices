# Blue-Green Deployment

Blue-Green Deployment is a deployment strategy that involves maintaining two identical environments, known as the "blue" and "green" environments. One environment (e.g., blue) is actively serving production traffic, while the other (green) is idle and used for updates

This strategy helps to minimize downtime and reduce risk by ensuring that two identical environments—referred to as Blue and Green—are available at any given time. One environment (say, Blue) serves the production traffic, while the other (Green) is updated with the new version of the application. Once the Green environment has been thoroughly tested and validated, traffic is switched from Blue to Green, making the updated environment live. This approach allows for seamless, non-disruptive deployments and provides a rollback mechanism if issues arise.

### Two Identical Environments:

- Blue Environment: The current live environment that serves production traffic. This environment remains untouched until the new version is ready for deployment.
- Green Environment: The staging environment where the new version of the application is deployed. This environment is isolated from the production traffic until the update is validated.

### Switching Traffic:

Once the Green environment is validated, traffic is switched from the Blue environment to the Green environment. This switch can be achieved through DNS changes, load balancer adjustments, or using a feature toggle system.

### Rollback Capability:

If any issues are detected in the Green environment after the switch, the deployment can be rolled back by redirecting traffic back to the Blue environment. This quick rollback mechanism is one of the major advantages of Blue-Green Deployment.

### Tools Supporting Blue-Green Deployment:

- Cloud Platforms: AWS (Elastic Beanstalk, ECS, Lambda), Google Cloud Platform, Azure
- CI/CD Tools: Jenkins, GitLab CI, Azure DevOps, Spinnaker
- Load Balancers: AWS Elastic Load Balancer, NGINX, F5
- Feature Management: LaunchDarkly, Unleash
