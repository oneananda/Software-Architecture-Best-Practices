# Blue-Green Deployment on AWS

Blue-Green Deployment is a strategy that helps us reduce downtime and risks during deployments by using two identical environments—Blue and Green. Here's a step-by-step guide on how to set up Blue-Green Deployment using AWS Elastic Beanstalk.

## Prerequisites

- AWS Account
- AWS Elastic Beanstalk CLI
- AWS CLI configured with your credentials

## Overview

In this setup:
- The **Blue environment** is our current live environment.
- The **Green environment** is where we deploy and test our new version.
- Once the Green environment is validated, we switch traffic from Blue to Green.

## Step-by-Step Guide

### Step 1: Create the Blue Environment

1. **Create an Elastic Beanstalk Application:**
   - Open the AWS Management Console.
   - Go to **Elastic Beanstalk**.
   - Click **Create Application**.
   - Name your application, for example, `my-app`.
   - Choose a platform (e.g., Node.js, Python, .NET, etc.).
   - Upload your application code or use the sample provided by AWS.
   - Click **Create Environment**, choose **Web server environment**, and follow the prompts to create your **Blue environment** (e.g., `my-app-blue`).

### Step 2: Create the Green Environment

1. **Clone the Blue Environment to Create Green:**
   - Go back to your Elastic Beanstalk application dashboard.
   - Under the Actions menu for your Blue environment (`my-app-blue`), select **Clone Environment**.
   - Name the new environment, for example, `my-app-green`.
   - Review the settings and launch the Green environment.

### Step 3: Deploy the New Version to Green

1. **Deploy Your New Version to the Green Environment:**
   - Select the Green environment (`my-app-green`).
   - Click **Upload and deploy**.
   - Upload the new version of your application.
   - Wait for the deployment to complete and ensure everything looks good.

### Step 4: Validate the Green Environment

1. **Test Your Green Environment:**
   - Access the URL of your Green environment to test.
   - Perform functional testing, load testing, and any other necessary checks to ensure the new version is working as expected.

### Step 5: Switch Traffic from Blue to Green

1. **Swap the Environments:**
   - Once validated, go to your Elastic Beanstalk application dashboard.
   - Under **Actions** for your Green environment (`my-app-green`), select **Swap Environment URLs**.
   - This action will redirect production traffic from the Blue environment to the Green environment.

### Step 6: Monitor and Rollback if Necessary

1. **Monitor Your Green Environment:**
   - Keep an eye on the Green environment using CloudWatch metrics, logs, and any other monitoring tools you have in place.
   - If everything works well, congratulations! You’ve successfully completed a Blue-Green Deployment.
   
2. **Rollback (if needed):**
   - If you encounter issues, quickly swap back by repeating the **Swap Environment URLs** step. This will send traffic back to the Blue environment, providing a fast rollback.

### Step 7: Cleanup

1. **Decide What to Do with the Blue Environment:**
   - If you’re confident that the Green environment is stable, you can terminate the Blue environment to save costs.
   - Alternatively, keep it idle and ready for the next deployment cycle.

## Additional Tips

- **Automate with Scripts:** Use the AWS CLI or AWS SDKs to automate the Blue-Green Deployment process further.
- **Use Route 53 for Advanced Traffic Switching:** If you need more control over traffic switching, consider using AWS Route 53 weighted routing.

## Conclusion

Blue-Green Deployment on AWS helps you deploy with minimal downtime and easy rollback options. By following these steps, you can ensure your updates are smooth and reliable. Happy deploying!
