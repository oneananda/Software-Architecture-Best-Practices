# Canary Release / Canary Deployment

## Overview

Canary Release, also known as Canary Deployment, is a technique used to reduce the risk of deploying new software changes. It involves directing a small portion of your production traffic to a newly developed module or feature before fully rolling it out to all users. This method helps in testing the new changes in a real-world environment without affecting the entire user base.

## Why Use Canary Release?

Deploying new features or changes directly to all users can be risky. There could be hidden bugs, performance issues, or unforeseen errors that might disrupt your service. Canary Release mitigates these risks by allowing you to:
- **Test Gradually:** Only a small subset of users are exposed to the new changes initially.
- **Detect Issues Early:** By monitoring this small group, you can quickly spot and fix any problems before they impact everyone.
- **Roll Back Easily:** If something goes wrong, rolling back is easier and impacts only the canary group.

## How It Works

1. **Start Small:** Deploy the new module (e.g., a new payment microservice) and direct a small fraction of production traffic (say 1-5%) to it.
   
2. **Monitor Performance:** Keep a close eye on metrics like success rates, error rates, response times, and user feedback. Compare these metrics with those of the old system.

3. **Gradual Rollout:** As confidence in the new module grows, gradually increase the traffic directed to it. This can be done in increments, such as moving from 5% to 10%, then 25%, and so on.

4. **Full Rollout:** Once the new module proves stable and performs well under increasing loads, route all traffic to it.

5. **Retirement:** Finally, decommission the old module once the new system is fully adopted and stable.

## Benefits

- **Risk Reduction:** Only a small subset of users is affected if issues arise, minimizing the overall impact.
- **Improved Stability:** Allows for testing in a live environment without compromising the entire service.
- **Real-Time Feedback:** Immediate insights into the new module’s performance help in making data-driven decisions for scaling or rolling back.

## When to Use

Canary Releases are suitable for:
- Introducing new microservices or modules.
- Applying the Strangler Pattern to incrementally replace parts of a monolith.
- Deploying significant updates that could impact service performance or functionality.

## Conclusion

Using Canary Releases is a smart way to manage the deployment of new software changes. By gradually shifting traffic, you can confidently validate new features in production, ensuring a smooth transition from old to new without jeopardizing the user experience.
