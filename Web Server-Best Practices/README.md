# Web Server-Best Practices

To keep the web server running smoothly and securely, always keep the software updated and use HTTPS to protect data. Limit access with strong passwords and firewalls, and turn off any features you don’t need. Speed up the site by using caching, compressing files, and optimizing images. Distribute traffic evenly with load balancers and consider using a CDN to deliver content faster. Keep an eye on server performance with monitoring tools, and regularly back up the configurations. Document the setup so it’s easy for anyone to manage, and make sure the team knows the basics of security and server management. Regular maintenance, like checking logs and applying patches, will help you catch and fix problems early.
