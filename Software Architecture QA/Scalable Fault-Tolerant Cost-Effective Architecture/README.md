# Building Scalable, Fault-Tolerant and Cost-Effective Architecture

## Question 

How will you build Scalable, Fault-Tolerant and Cost-Effective Architecture for an application which handles milions of transactions per day?

We need to ensure the 

- High availablity
- Data consistency
- Minimal lateny 

for all the users which spans across different continents.

- What are the key components you suggest ?

- What are the technologies availabe ?

- What are the general considerations for bulding such architecture ?

### Answer

Key components and technologies

**Cloud Provider:** We can choose any of the following leading cloud providers

- Amazon Web Services
- Azure Cloud
- Google Cloud

**Load Balancing:** Deploy any load balancing services

- AWS Global Accelerator
- Azure Front Door
- Google Cloud Global LoadBalancer

This is to direct traffic to the nearest regional data center, ensuring low latency and high availability.

**Microservices Architecture:** (Optional)

Break down the application into microservices, each responsible for a specific business function (e.g., user management, product catalog, payment processing). This allows independent scaling and easier management.

**Containerization and Orchestration:** 

Use Docker for containerization and Kubernetes (or AWS EKS/Azure AKS) for orchestrating the microservices. This provides portability and efficient resource usage.Containerization and Orchestration: Use Docker for containerization and Kubernetes (or AWS EKS/Azure AKS) for orchestrating the microservices.

**Data Storage Options:**

- Relational Database: 
Use a distributed database like Amazon Aurora Global Database or Google Cloud Spanner for transactional data, ensuring global consistency with multi-region replication.
- NoSQL Database: 
Implement a NoSQL database like DynamoDB or Cosmos DB for handling user sessions, and other high-velocity data. Ensure that data is replicated across regions.
- Cache Layer: 
Use a distributed cache like Redis or Memcached to store frequently accessed and infrequently updated data, reducing load on the databases and improving response times.

Example: `User session data, Static pages, Product catalog information`

**Content Delivery Network (CDN):** 

Use a CDN like Amazon CloudFront or Azure CDN to serve static content (e.g., images, CSS, JS) closer to the user, reducing latency.
