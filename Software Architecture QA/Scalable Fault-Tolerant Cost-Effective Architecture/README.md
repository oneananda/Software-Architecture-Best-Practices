# Building Scalable, Fault-Tolerant and Cost-Effective Architecture

## Question 

How will you build Scalable, Fault-Tolerant and Cost-Effective Architecture for an application which handles milions of transactions per day?

We need to ensure the 

- High availablity
- Data consistency
- Minimal lateny 

for all the users which spans across different continents.

- What are the key components you suggest ?

- What are the technologies availabe ?

- What are the general considerations for bulding such architecture ?

### Answer

Key components and technologies

**Cloud Provider:** We can choose any of the following leading cloud providers

- Amazon Web Services
- Azure Cloud
- Google Cloud

**Load Balancing:** Deploy any load balancing services

- AWS Global Accelerator
- Azure Front Door
- Google Cloud Global LoadBalancer

This is to direct traffic to the nearest regional data center, ensuring low latency and high availability.

**Microservices Architecture:** (Optional)

Break down the application into microservices, each responsible for a specific business function (e.g., user management, product catalog, payment processing). This allows independent scaling and easier management.

**Containerization and Orchestration:** 

Use Docker for containerization and Kubernetes (or AWS EKS/Azure AKS) for orchestrating the microservices. This provides portability and efficient resource usage.Containerization and Orchestration: Use Docker for containerization and Kubernetes (or AWS EKS/Azure AKS) for orchestrating the microservices. This provides portability and efficient resource usage.

**Data Storage Options:**

- Relational Database: 
Use a distributed database like Amazon Aurora Global Database or Google Cloud Spanner for transactional data, ensuring global consistency with multi-region replication.
- NoSQL Database: 
Implement a NoSQL database like DynamoDB or Cosmos DB for handling user sessions, and other high-velocity data. Ensure that data is replicated across regions.
- Cache Layer: 
Use a distributed cache like Redis or Memcached to store frequently accessed and infrequently updated data, reducing load on the databases and improving response times.

Example: `User session data, Static pages, Product catalog information`

**Content Delivery Network (CDN):** 

Use a CDN like Amazon CloudFront or Azure CDN to serve static content (e.g., images, CSS, JS) closer to the user, reducing latency.

**Event-Driven Architecture:** 

Implement an event-driven model using a message broker like AWS SQS/SNS, Azure Service Bus, or Kafka for asynchronous communication between microservices, improving scalability and decoupling services.

**Auto-scaling:** 

Set up auto-scaling policies for both the application layer and the database to automatically adjust resources based on traffic and usage patterns.

**Security:**

- Encryption : Implement E2E encryption for data in transit (eg TLS) and in the rest (AES-256)
- IAM Policies: Enforce strict identity and access management policies, using least privilege principles.
- WAF and DDoS Protection: Use Web Application Firewalls (e.g., AWS WAF, Azure WAF) and DDoS protection (e.g., AWS Shield, Azure DDoS Protection) to secure the application against attacks.

**Monitoring and Logging:**

- Centralized Logging: Use a centralized logging system like ELK Stack (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana) or Azure Monitor to collect and analyze logs from all microservices.
- Monitoring: Implement monitoring tools like Prometheus, Grafana, or AWS CloudWatch for real-time performance tracking and alerting.

**Disaster Recovery and Backup:**

- Multi-Region Deployment: Setup the services in multi region setup to get the failover scenario and DR (Disaster Recovery)
- Backups: Regularly back up databases and critical data using automated backup services (e.g., AWS Backup, Azure Backup) and store them in a separate region.

**Cost Optimization:**

- Reserved Instances and Spot Instances: Use a mix of on-demand, reserved, and spot instances to optimize costs based on predictable and variable workloads.
- Serverless Services: Utilize serverless technologies (e.g., AWS Lambda, Azure Functions) where applicable to reduce operational overhead and costs.

These are the general considerations for the above question, we can customize based on our needs if any specific cloud provider is preffered.
