# VPC Peering 

`VPC Peering` is a networking feature in cloud platforms like Amazon Web Services (AWS), Google Cloud, and Microsoft Azure that allows connection between two or more Virtual Private Clouds (VPCs) so that they can communicate with each other as if they were part of the same network. This enables traffic routing between VPCs privately, using private IP addresses, without requiring the traffic to go over the internet.
