# Caching

Caching is the technique generally store the frequently acccessed data in an intermediate temporary place instead of server, which is typically faster and less resource-intensive than fetching the data from the original source, such as a server or database. By retrieving data from the cache instead of the server, applications can reduce load times, lower costs, and save computational resources.

## Why we need to use caching ?

The main benefits of using cahing are

- Improved performance 
By storing the frequently accessed data closer to the application significantly increases the performance of the application.

- Reduced latencey
This minimizes the delay in serving the data to the users, thus reducing the latency.

- Decreased Load on Resources: 
Caching offloads repetitive work from backend systems like databases and APIs, reducing the demand on these resources.

- Scalability: 
Caching allows applications to handle more users and higher loads by reducing the need to generate the same data repeatedly.
