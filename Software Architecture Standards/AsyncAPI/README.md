# AsyncAPI

AsyncAPI is an open-source initiative that provides a specification and set of tools for defining, building, and maintaining event-driven APIs. It is similar to what OpenAPI (formerly known as Swagger) does for RESTful APIs, but specifically tailored for asynchronous and event-driven architectures.

## Key Features of AsyncAPI:

**Specification for Event-Driven Architectures:** AsyncAPI offers a standard way to describe asynchronous APIs, including protocols like 
- Kafka, 
- MQTT, 
- AMQP, 
- WebSockets, 
- and others. 

It defines how messages are published and consumed, along with details about message payloads, servers, channels, and operations.

**Documentation:** Just like OpenAPI, AsyncAPI provides a format to generate interactive documentation. This makes it easier for developers to understand and interact with event-driven services.
