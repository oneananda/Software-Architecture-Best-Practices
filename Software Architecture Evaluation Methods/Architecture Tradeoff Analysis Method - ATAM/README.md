# Architecture Tradeoff Analysis Method - ATAM

This is a `systematic process` used to `evaluate and assess the quality attributes` of Software Architecture developed by Software Engineering Institute (SEI).

`ATAM` is useful to stakeholders to understand the tradeoffs in the current / planned architecture and how changing the architecture can affect the quality attributes like
- Performance
- Modifiablity 
- Security 
- Reliablity
