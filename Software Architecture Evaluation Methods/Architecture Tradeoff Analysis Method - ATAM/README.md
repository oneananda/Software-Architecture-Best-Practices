# Architecture Tradeoff Analysis Method - ATAM

This is a `systematic process` used to `evaluate and assess the quality attributes` of Software Architecture developed by Software Engineering Institute (SEI).

`ATAM` is useful to stakeholders to understand the tradeoffs in the current / planned architecture and how changing the architecture can affect the quality attributes like
- Performance
- Modifiablity 
- Availablity
- Security 
- Reliablity

This analysis usually happen in the early stages of SDLC, or before in any case of change of architecture.

## Key things in ATAM

### Quality Attributes:

Asseses on how the SW Architecture supports the quality parameters

- Performance 
- Security 
- Availability
- Modifiability

### Stakeholder Involvement:

ATAM involves the following potential stakeholders for assessing,

- Developers 
- Architects 
- project managers 
- End-users

to ensure that the architecture meets the needs and expectations of all parties.

### Scenario-Based Analysis

This method explores different scenario based analysis to explore different aspects of the architecture, these scenarios are mostly hypothical and used to evaluate on how the system reacts to the scenarios.

### Tradeoff Analysis

ATAM helps identify tradeoffs between competing quality attributes. 

_For instance, improving performance `might negatively impact modifiability`, and ATAM helps stakeholders understand and make informed decisions about such tradeoffs._
