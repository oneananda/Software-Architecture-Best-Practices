# Architecture Tradeoff Analysis Method - ATAM

This is a `systematic process` used to `evaluate and assess the quality attributes` of Software Architecture developed by Software Engineering Institute (SEI).

`ATAM` is useful to stakeholders to understand the tradeoffs in the current / planned architecture and how changing the architecture can affect the quality attributes like
- Performance
- Modifiablity 
- Availablity
- Security 
- Reliablity

## Key things in ATAM

### Quality Attributes:

Asseses on how the SW Architecture supports the quality parameters

- Performance 
- Security 
- Availability
- Modifiability

### Stakeholder Involvement:

ATAM involves the following potential stakeholders for assessing,

- Developers 
- Architects 
- project managers 
- End-users

to ensure that the architecture meets the needs and expectations of all parties.
