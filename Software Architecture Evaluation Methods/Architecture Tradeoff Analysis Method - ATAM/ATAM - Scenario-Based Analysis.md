# Scenario-Based Analysis in the context of ATAM

## Performance Scenarios

### Scenario: 

The system needs to handle 10,000 simultaneous users during a peak load period.

### Purpose: 

To evaluate how the architecture scales under high traffic and whether it can maintain acceptable response times.

### Considerations: 

Network bandwidth, server capacity, load balancing mechanisms, and database performance.

In case of cloud, we need to look into Auto-Scaling capacity

---

## Security Scenarios

### Scenario: 

An unauthorized user attempts to access confidential data within the system.

### Considerations: 

Authentication mechanisms, encryption methods, role-based access control, and logging/auditing features.

---

## Modifiability Scenarios

### Scenario: 

A new payment gateway needs to be integrated into the system without significant downtime.

---
## Availability Scenarios

### Scenario: 

The system experiences a hardware failure in one of its primary servers.

---

## Usability Scenarios

### Scenario: 

A new user must be able to navigate and complete a transaction within 5 minutes of using the system for the first time.

---

## Reliability Scenarios

### Scenario: 

The system must recover automatically within 5 minutes after an unexpected crash.

---

## Interoperability Scenarios

### Scenario: 

The system must integrate seamlessly with a third-party API for payment processing.

---

## Scalability Scenarios

### Scenario: 

The system must scale from 100 users to 100,000 users within a short time frame due to a marketing campaign.

---

## Maintainability Scenarios

### Scenario: 

A bug is found in the code, and a fix needs to be deployed without impacting other parts of the system.

---

## Extensibility Scenarios

### Scenario: 

A new feature needs to be added to the system to support a new business requirement.
