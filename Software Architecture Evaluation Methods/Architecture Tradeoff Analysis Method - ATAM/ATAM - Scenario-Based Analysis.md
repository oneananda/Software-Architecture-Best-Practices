# Scenario-Based Analysis in the context of ATAM

## Performance Scenarios

### Scenario: 

The system needs to handle 10,000 simultaneous users during a peak load period.

### Purpose: 

To evaluate how the architecture scales under high traffic and whether it can maintain acceptable response times.

### Considerations: 

Network bandwidth, server capacity, load balancing mechanisms, and database performance.

In case of cloud, we need to look into Auto-Scaling capacity

## Security Scenarios

### Scenario: 

An unauthorized user attempts to access confidential data within the system.

---

## Modifiability Scenarios

### Scenario: 

A new payment gateway needs to be integrated into the system without significant downtime.

---
## Availability Scenarios

### Scenario: 

The system experiences a hardware failure in one of its primary servers.
