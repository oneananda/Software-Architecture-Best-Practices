# Messaging Best Practices

**Use Message Acknowledgments**

- Acknowledge after processing: Ensure that you only acknowledge a message after it has been successfully processed. This prevents message loss in case of processing failures.

- Automatic retries: For failed messages, configure automatic retries before moving them to a dead letter queue (DLQ).

**Leverage Dead Letter Queues (DLQ)**

- Handle failures gracefully: Use DLQs to capture messages that can’t be processed after multiple attempts. Ensure you monitor the DLQ and have a process to analyze and reprocess the messages.
