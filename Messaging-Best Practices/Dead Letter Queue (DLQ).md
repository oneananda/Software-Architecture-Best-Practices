# Dead Letter Queue (DLQ)

A Dead Letter Queue (DLQ) is like a special inbox for messages that couldn’t be delivered or processed properly. Imagine you're running an online store, and for some reason, a customer's order keeps failing—maybe their payment didn’t go through, or there was some issue with the information they provided. Instead of losing track of that order completely, you move it to a special folder where you can review and fix the problem later. That's essentially what a DLQ does for software systems.
