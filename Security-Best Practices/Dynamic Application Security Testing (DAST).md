# Dynamic Application Security Testing (DAST)

`Dynamic Application Security Testing (DAST)` is a method used to analyze a running application to identify security vulnerabilities from an external perspective. It involves simulating attacks on the application while it is operational to detect vulnerabilities such as injection flaws, authentication issues, and security misconfigurations. Unlike SAST, DAST does not require access to the source code and is typically performed during the later stages of development or in production environments.

### Key Features of DAST

1. **Runtime Testing**
   - Evaluates applications during execution.
2. **Black-box Testing**
   - Simulates external attacks without access to the internal code.
3. **Automated Vulnerability Detection**
   - Scans for common vulnerabilities like SQL injection, XSS, and more.
4. **Platform Agnostic**
   - Works on any technology stack without needing to understand the underlying code.
5. **Detailed Reporting**
   - Provides actionable insights for developers to patch vulnerabilities.

### Compliance:

DAST tools ensure that web applications comply with various security standards (e.g., OWASP, PCI-DSS, NIST), helping businesses meet regulatory requirements.
