# Dynamic Application Security Testing (DAST)

`Dynamic Application Security Testing (DAST)` is a method used to analyze a running application to identify security vulnerabilities from an external perspective. It involves simulating attacks on the application while it is operational to detect vulnerabilities such as injection flaws, authentication issues, and security misconfigurations. Unlike SAST, DAST does not require access to the source code and is typically performed during the later stages of development or in production environments.
