# Static Application Security Testing (SAST)

`Static Application Security Testing (SAST)` is a method used to analyze an application's source code, bytecode, or binary code to find security vulnerabilities without executing the program. This form of testing is often conducted during the early stages of software development, allowing developers to identify and resolve security issues before the application is released.
