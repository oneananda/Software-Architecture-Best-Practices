# Container security

`Container security` is the practice of protecting containerized applications and their environments from threats and vulnerabilities. Containers, popularized by technologies like Docker and Kubernetes, are lightweight and portable software environments that package applications and their dependencies together. However, with the rise in container adoption, security has become a critical concern.

### Tools for Container Security:
- **Clair**: Open-source project for vulnerability scanning.
- **Aqua Security**: Commercial tool for container security.
- **Twistlock**: Container and cloud-native security platform.
- **Sysdig Secure**: For monitoring and securing containers at runtime.
- **Falco**: Runtime security tool that detects anomalous activity in containers.
- **Open Policy Agent (OPA)**: Policy engine that can enforce security policies.
