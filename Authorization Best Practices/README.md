# Authorization Best Practices in Software Architecture

When building software, securing your application's access is crucial. Here’s a list of best practices to help you set up robust authorization:

## 1. Principle of Least Privilege (PoLP)
Give users and services only the permissions they need to do their job—no more, no less. This way, if an account gets compromised, the potential damage is minimized.

## 2. Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)
Organize permissions by roles (like Admin, User, Viewer). Assign users to these roles rather than handling permissions individually—it's easier to manage and keeps things secure.
