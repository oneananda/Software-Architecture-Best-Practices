#**Principle of Least Privilege (PoLP)**

The **Principle of Least Privilege (PoLP)** is a foundational security concept that stipulates every user, program, or process should operate using the minimum privileges necessary to complete its tasks. By enforcing this principle, organizations can significantly reduce their attack surface and minimize the potential damage from accidental errors or malicious attacks.
