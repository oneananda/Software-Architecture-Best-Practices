## 1. Readability
Readability is one of the most critical aspects of code quality. Well-written code is self-explanatory and easy to follow.
- **Use meaningful names**: Variable, function, and class names should clearly describe their purpose.
- **Consistent formatting**: Follow a consistent code style, including indentation, spacing, and bracket placement.
- **Comments and documentation**: Use comments to explain non-obvious code sections and ensure comprehensive documentation is in place.
- **Avoid deep nesting**: Too many nested conditions or loops can make code harder to understand.

## 2. Maintainability
Write code that can be easily extended or modified in the future.
