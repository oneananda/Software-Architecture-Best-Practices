# Code smells

`Code smells` are the scenario where the the code is poorly written, not necessarily to produce wrong output or buggy result, rather the code may introduce complexities in managing, extending.

Over time, code smells can lead to code that is harder to maintain, scale, or debug, which increases the technical debt of a project. Identifying and refactoring code smells is key to maintaining long-term code quality.

**Types of code smells**:

1. **Duplicated Code**  
   Same or similar code exists in multiple places, making it harder to maintain and update consistently.
