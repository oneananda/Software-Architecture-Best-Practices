# OData (Open Data Protocol)

## 📖 Overview
OData (Open Data Protocol) is an open protocol for building and consuming RESTful APIs.  
It extends traditional REST APIs with standardized query capabilities, making data access **uniform, discoverable, and queryable** across different systems.  

Originally developed by Microsoft, OData is now an **OASIS standard** and widely used in enterprise APIs (e.g., Microsoft Graph, SAP APIs).
