# OData (Open Data Protocol)

## üìñ Overview
OData (Open Data Protocol) is an open protocol for building and consuming RESTful APIs.  
It extends traditional REST APIs with standardized query capabilities, making data access **uniform, discoverable, and queryable** across different systems.  

Originally developed by Microsoft, OData is now an **OASIS standard** and widely used in enterprise APIs (e.g., Microsoft Graph, SAP APIs).

## ‚ú® Key Features
- **Standardized Query Syntax**  
  Supports `$filter`, `$select`, `$expand`, `$orderby`, `$top`, `$skip`, etc.
- **Metadata Discovery**  
  APIs expose metadata (`$metadata` endpoint) describing entities, relationships, and types.
- **Entity Data Model (EDM)**  
  Provides a structured schema for data and relationships.
- **Interoperability**  
  Works across multiple platforms and languages.
- **Supports CRUD**  
  Create, Read, Update, Delete via standard HTTP verbs.

## üèó Architecture

OData follows a **REST + Query Language** approach:
- **Resource Model**: Entities and collections (like REST resources).
- **Query Options**: Uniform syntax for filtering, ordering, and projections.
- **Metadata**: Auto-discovery via `/$metadata`.
