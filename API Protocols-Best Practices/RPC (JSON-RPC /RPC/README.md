# RPC (Remote Procedure Call)

## ðŸ“– Overview
Remote Procedure Call (**RPC**) is a protocol style that allows a program to execute procedures (functions or methods) on a remote server as if they were local calls.  
Unlike REST or GraphQL (which focus on resources and queries), RPC is **action-oriented**, where the client invokes remote methods directly with parameters.

Two common formats:
- **JSON-RPC**: Lightweight RPC protocol using JSON for requests/responses.
- **XML-RPC**: Older protocol using XML over HTTP to encode calls and results.

## âœ¨ Key Features
- **Procedure-based** â€“ APIs expose *methods* instead of resources.
- **Lightweight** â€“ Minimal overhead compared to SOAP.
- **Transport-agnostic** â€“ Commonly over HTTP, but can use TCP, WebSocket, etc.
- **Synchronous & Asynchronous support** â€“ Depending on implementation.
- **Language-neutral** â€“ Any language that can parse JSON/XML can use it.
