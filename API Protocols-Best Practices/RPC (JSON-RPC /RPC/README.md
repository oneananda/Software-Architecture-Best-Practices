# RPC (Remote Procedure Call)

## ðŸ“– Overview
Remote Procedure Call (**RPC**) is a protocol style that allows a program to execute procedures (functions or methods) on a remote server as if they were local calls.  
Unlike REST or GraphQL (which focus on resources and queries), RPC is **action-oriented**, where the client invokes remote methods directly with parameters.

Two common formats:
- **JSON-RPC**: Lightweight RPC protocol using JSON for requests/responses.
- **XML-RPC**: Older protocol using XML over HTTP to encode calls and results.
