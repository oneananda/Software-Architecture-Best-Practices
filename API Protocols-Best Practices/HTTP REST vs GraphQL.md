# HTTP REST (Representational State Transfer) vs GraphQL

### Key Differences Between HTTP REST and GraphQL:

| Feature               | REST                         | GraphQL                       |
|-----------------------|------------------------------|-------------------------------|
| **Data Fetching**      | Predefined endpoints, fixed responses | Client-defined queries, flexible responses |
| **Number of Endpoints**| Multiple (one per resource)  | Single endpoint (typically `/graphql`) |
| **Over/Under-fetching**| Common (over-fetching or needing multiple calls) | Avoided (client requests exactly what it needs) |
| **Request Flexibility**| Low flexibility, fixed structure | High flexibility, clients specify required data |
| **Performance**        | Multiple round trips for related data | Single request for nested data but can lead to over-fetching |
| **Caching**            | Native HTTP caching mechanisms | Requires custom caching solutions |
| **Real-Time Data**     | Requires additional solutions like WebSockets | Supports real-time data through subscriptions |
| **Learning Curve**     | Easier, based on standard HTTP | Steeper, requires understanding of schemas and queries |

### Use Cases:

- **REST** is a good choice when:
  - Simplicity and standardization are important.
  - Caching at the HTTP level is crucial.
  - The API has well-defined resources that don’t require flexible querying.

- **GraphQL** is a good choice when:
  - Flexibility in data retrieval is essential.
  - Reducing the number of API calls is critical.
  - There’s a need to fetch nested or related data in a single query.
  - Real-time updates are required.

In summary, REST is a more rigid and standardized way to interact with APIs, while GraphQL offers more flexibility and efficiency but at the cost of increased complexity in implementation.
