## Introduction

Design patterns are proven solutions to common software design problems. They provide a template that can be used to address particular design challenges, fostering code reuse, scalability, and flexibility. This guide covers various design patterns, categorized into **Creational**, **Structural**, and **Behavioral** patterns, along with the best practices for implementing them.

## Why Design Patterns?

- **Code Reusability**: Implement solutions that are applicable across different projects.
- **Maintainability**: Reduce complexity and improve the readability of code.
- **Scalability**: Create architectures that can handle changes and growth over time.
- **Problem-Solving**: Use established methods to tackle common software problems efficiently.
