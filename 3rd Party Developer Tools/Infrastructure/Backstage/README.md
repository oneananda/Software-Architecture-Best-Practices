Imagine you're joining a company with lots of different projects, services, and tools. It can feel overwhelming to know where everything is, what each service does, or who to talk to about specific projects. Backstage is like a one-stop shop or a central dashboard that organizes all this information in one place, making it easy for you and your team to find what you need quickly.

### What Can Backstage Do?

**Organizes Everything:** Backstage is kid of a big, organized library of all the company's software projects, services, and tools. Instead of guessing or searching everywhere, you just go to Backstage, and you can see everything laid out neatly.

**Find Who Owns What:** If you need to know who’s responsible for a specific service or project, Backstage shows you. It's like a directory that tells you who owns what, so you always know who to contact.
