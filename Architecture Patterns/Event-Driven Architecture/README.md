# Event-Driven Architecture

**Event-Driven Architecture** uses events to trigger and communicate between services or components. It decouples components and promotes asynchronous processing.

- **Use case:** Real-time applications, systems with unpredictable workloads
- **Benefits:** High scalability, loose coupling, flexibility
- **Drawbacks:** Debugging and tracing can be complex
