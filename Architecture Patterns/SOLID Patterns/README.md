# SOLID Patterns

## Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)

SRP - One class should be responsible for one thing only. 

This means that a class should have only one reason to change.

This principle helps in reducing the complexity of the code and makes it easier to maintain and test.

## Open/Closed Principle (OCP)
## Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP)
## Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)
## Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)
