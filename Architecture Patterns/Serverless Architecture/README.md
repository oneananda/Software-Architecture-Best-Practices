# Serverless Architecture

**Serverless Architecture** allows developers to focus on writing code without worrying about managing the underlying infrastructure. Applications are run on managed services, and you pay only for the resources you use.

- **Use case:** Applications with unpredictable or infrequent workloads
- **Benefits:** No infrastructure management, auto-scaling
- **Drawbacks:** Vendor lock-in, cold start latency
