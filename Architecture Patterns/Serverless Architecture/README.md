# Serverless Architecture

**Serverless Architecture** allows developers to focus on writing code without worrying about managing the underlying infrastructure. Applications are run on managed services, and you pay only for the resources you use.

- **Use case:** Applications with unpredictable or infrequent workloads
- **Benefits:** No infrastructure management, auto-scaling
- **Drawbacks:** Vendor lock-in, cold start latency

### Avoiding or reducing cold starts

`Avoiding or reducing cold starts` in serverless architectures is important to minimize latency during the initial invocation of a function. Cold starts happen when a serverless function has been inactive for a while, and the cloud provider has to initialize a new execution environment before handling the request.
