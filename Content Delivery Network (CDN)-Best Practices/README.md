# Content Delivery Network (CDN) Best Practices

A Content Delivery Network (CDN) is a system of distributed servers that deliver web content to users based on their geographic location, the origin of the webpage, and a content delivery server. 

We will see what are the best practices for implementing and optimizing a CDN for improved performance, security, and scalability of your web applications.

## Introduction
A CDN helps improve the speed, security, and reliability of your website by distributing content closer to the users' locations. By following these best practices, you can ensure that your CDN implementation is efficient, secure, and provides the best user experience.

## Why Use a CDN?
- **Improved Load Times:** By caching content closer to the end-users, CDNs reduce latency and improve page load times.
- **Increased Availability and Redundancy:** CDNs provide load balancing and failover capabilities, enhancing the availability of your website.
- **Enhanced Security:** CDNs offer security features such as DDoS protection, Web Application Firewall (WAF), and secure token authentication.
- **Cost Efficiency:** By offloading traffic to CDN servers, you can reduce bandwidth costs and server load on your origin servers.
