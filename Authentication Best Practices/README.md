# Authentication Best Practices in Software Architecture

Securing your APIs and applications starts with strong authentication. 

We will jump to best practices that will help keep your APIs and applications safe:

## 1. Use OAuth 2.0 and OpenID Connect
Leverage OAuth 2.0 for authorization and OpenID Connect for authentication. These standards provide a secure way to authenticate users and authorize access to resources, and they’re widely supported across platforms.

## 2. Use API Keys Carefully
If you use API keys, treat them like passwords: keep them secret and avoid embedding them in your code. Use them in conjunction with other authentication methods for added security.

## 3. Implement JSON Web Tokens (JWT)
JWTs are a popular choice for API authentication. Use them to securely transmit information between parties as a JSON object. Make sure to sign tokens with a strong algorithm like `RS256` and validate them properly on the server side.

## 4. Adopt Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)
MFA adds an additional layer of security by requiring multiple forms of identification (something the user knows, something the user has, and/or something the user is).

## 5. Use Password Hashing
Passwords should never be stored in plaintext. Use a secure, slow hashing algorithm like bcrypt.

## 5. Use Password Salting
Salting (adding a random value to each password before hashing) ensures that identical passwords are hashed to different values.
